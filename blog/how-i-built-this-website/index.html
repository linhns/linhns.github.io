        <div class="content">
            <h1 id="motivation"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#motivation" aria-label="Anchor link for: motivation">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>After a few years of leaving my website consisting of just 2 files <code>index.html</code> and <code>style.css</code>, together with some miscellanous git files,
I made a decision to upgrade it to include different sections and especially, a blog that I can write whenever I like.
Obviously, using plain html files for this purpose is an arduous, painstaking task. Therefore I decided to go with an SSG.</p>
<h1 id="execution"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#execution" aria-label="Anchor link for: execution">Execution</a></h1>
<h2 id="why-i-chose-zola"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#why-i-chose-zola" aria-label="Anchor link for: why-i-chose-zola">Why I chose Zola</a></h2>
<p>Static site generators have been around for a long time, and there are hundreds of them to choose from.
<a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">Jamstack</a> has a summary of all available SSGs with details of backend language and templating language.</p>
<p>While I could go with more popular options on the list such as Jekyll or Hugo,
I found out Zola is built on Rust, and I can't stress how much I love it. That said, Zola is not without its downsides, particularly
regarding its template language Tera, which does not have editor support as much as other templating languages.
However, Zola struck me in terms of simplicity, and its clear <a href="https://www.getzola.org/documentation/">documentation</a>
shows exactly what needs to be done without all the fuss.
That fuss is exactly why, up to now, I still cannot understand Hugo and believe it's a mess.
One more thing, Zola is fast, extremely fast to build. I timed one of the production builds
and it took approximately 1 minute for my content to show up.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-decided-the-structure-of-this-website"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#how-i-decided-the-structure-of-this-website" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-i-decided-the-structure-of-this-website">How I decided the structure of this website</a></h2>
<p>After choosing Zola as the SSG, I need to structure my website around how Zola works. Luckily, this is quite simple,
and Zola allows users to freely construct their website, as long as content are stored in the <code>content</code> directory
and there is a template to render it in <code>templates</code> directory. Since I want each section and its pages to have their own look,
with some shared features. This is easy to do by creating <code>section.html</code> and extends it for a particular section, for example
<code>blog.html</code> for <em>blog</em>.</p>
<p>Currently, this website has 3 sections: <code>experience</code>, <code>projects</code>, <code>blog</code>. This is a good split for the content that I currently have,
but may change if I need more in the future. I also added <code>tags</code> as a way for readers to filter my blog posts according to tags.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-settle-on-the-style"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#how-i-settle-on-the-style" aria-label="Anchor link for: how-i-settle-on-the-style">How I settle on the style</a></h2>
<p>The previous version of this website did not look that bad, however I felt it was just a demonstration of Bootstrap.
That's why I wanted to create another look for it and in search of something new,
I stumbled on <a href="http://elizas.website">Eliza Weisman's website</a> and I found her terminal-esque theme pretty exciting,
thus I should attempt to make something similar to brush up my frontend skills, which I have barely used for a while.</p>
<p>Since Zola suggests the use of Sass, I had to learn on the go, and currently, lots of my styling perhaps can be done
in a simpler, more condensed manner. Right now, I would say that I'm pretty satisfied with the current look.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Anchor link for: conclusion">Conclusion</a></h1>
<h2 id="reflection"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#reflection" aria-label="Anchor link for: reflection">Reflection</a></h2>
<p>Building my website has been a great joy so far. It's time-consuming of course,
especially creating the dashed <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, which was harder than I thought.
But I believe that you learn more from the tough moments of life than the easy ones, and I'm certain
that I'm gonna go through many ordeals tougher than this in my life.</p>
<h2 id="future"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#future" aria-label="Anchor link for: future">Future</a></h2>
<p>There are features of Zola that I have not explored such as search and feeds,
which I plan to add to this website as soon as I can.
In the longer term, I may add some interactions to this website such as
typing <code>cd ~/projects</code> will actually take readers to the <code>projects</code> section.</p>
<hr />
<p>I want to thanks <a href="https://github.com/hawkw">Eliza Weisman</a> for her great website that inspired my design and
<a href="https://github.com/Xe">Christine Dodrill</a>(Xe Iaso) for another wonderful personal website, which influenced some of the customizations.
Especially, the use of border as underline is extremely smart. I may also add some AI-generated images to my website soon :).</p>
